# Assignment 1

This code uses an agent based model which captures behaviour within an environment. This code builds agents within a space and gets them to interact with each other. It can read in environmental data, randomise the order of the agent and get agents to interact with the enviornment. The model is then displayed as an animation and initialised with data from the web, the model is contained within a GUI.

My code is split into a README file describing the code, 6 files with each separate practical in and then the text file to be used in IO practical onwards. 

These files can be found [here](https://github.com/eleanorb19/eleanorb19.github.io).

Within each practical file there is a separated agent_framework file which corresponds to the practical.
